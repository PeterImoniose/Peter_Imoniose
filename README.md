# 👋 Hi, I'm Avwerosuo Peter Imoniose

I'm a **Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in mathematics and engineering, and a passion for building data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.

With hands-on experience in **machine learning, predictive maintenance, and data analytics**, I design practical systems that turn data into insight—and insight into action. From modeling equipment health to analyzing global salary trends, my goal is to create tools that drive smarter decisions and real impact.

Currently pursuing my Master's in Applied Data Science in Engineering, I'm actively expanding a portfolio of applied projects that reflect my commitment to using **AI, automation, and statistical modeling** to optimize systems and empower people.
